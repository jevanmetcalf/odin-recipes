    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>My first big project is to make a recipe database using HTML, and to add design to it with CSS. 
        I am learning to code from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>, a free, newly updated curriculum recommended by current web developers. 
        They have resources for every step of the process, from starting out to finding a job. 
        It's great having a way to learn so much and know that what I'm doing is building to somthing substantive.</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
